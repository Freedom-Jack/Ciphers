# Cryptology
Here are some cool ciphers I want to show you guys.\n
I recommand using Java for Cryptology related stuff because Java has the most up-to-date cryptology libraries.\n
I hope you guys enjoy it!\n

## List of Topics:
1. Classic ciphers
   * Caesar
   * Affine
   * Vigenere
2. Symmetric ciphers
   * DES / AES
3. Asymmetric ciphers
   * RSA
   * Chinese Remainder Theorem
   * Miller-Rabin primality test
4. Hash fucntions for Cryptology and applications
   * Signature
   * MAC/HMAC
