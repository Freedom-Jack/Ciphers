# Cryptology
Here are some cool ciphers I want to show you guys.\
I recommand using Java for Cryptology related stuff because Java has the most up-to-date cryptology libraries.\
I hope you guys enjoy it!

## List of Topics:
1. Classic ciphers
   * Caesar
   * Affine
   * Vigenere
2. Symmetric ciphers
   * DES / AES
3. Asymmetric ciphers
   * RSA
   * Chinese Remainder Theorem
   * Miller-Rabin primality test
4. Hash fucntions for Cryptology and applications
   * Signature
   * MAC/HMAC

## Classic ciphers
1. Caesar cipher
  * Encryption:\
    The way Caesar cipher works is by shifting the alphabec down with a fix amount.
  * Decryption
2. Affine cipher
3. Vigenere
