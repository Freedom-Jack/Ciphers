A: What would you do in order to determine if the cipher is a transposition cipher or not?

	To check if the cipher text has the same vector frequency as English or not.


B: What would you do in order to determine if the cipher is a Caesar cipher or not?

	To check if the highest letter frequency is close to 13%, and treat it as letter 'E', 
	and decipher the entire message to validate.


C: What would you do in order to determine if the cipher is a monoalphabetic cipher or not?

	To check the index of coincidence, to see if it is closed to the English's index of coincidence.


D: What would you do in order to determine if the cipher is a polyalphabetic cipher or not?

	To check the index of coincidence, and also to check if the length of the text is multiples of a certain length,
	since polyalphabetic cipher is block cipher only.
